# Feature folder type

## Objective

**Feature folder type**: a folder flagged as holding features

## Requirements / notes

Default: a `kind` column on `folders` (`regular` / `feature`) rather than a new table, so existing folder nesting, sharing and archiving keep working.

## Context

Section "Feature folders" of the retired shared backlog.

Requested by Alex on 2026-10-13. A feature folder holds a hierarchy of features, each written as a business or product requirements document. Tasks are created from those feature documents, and opening the project folder shows a rollup of all tasks under each feature.

```
Project folder            (click it: task rollup per feature)
└── Feature folder
    └── Feature           (requirements doc)
        └── Sub-feature   (requirements doc, any depth)
            └── Tasks created from the doc
```

Today: folders already nest to any depth (`folders.parent_id`, `Folder#self_and_descendant_ids`), documents live in folders, and tasks already carry `document_id` and `folder_id`. What is missing is a way to mark a folder or document as a feature, task creation from inside a feature doc, and the per-feature rollup.

## Acceptance criteria

- Feature folder type works as described in the Objective, for a signed-in member of the Space, in the web app.
- Anything stated in Requirements / notes (including any named default) is implemented or deliberately changed with the reason recorded.
- Failed API calls show an error to the user.
- Tests cover the new behaviour; a feature doc in `docs/features/` is written (or the existing one updated) and this file is removed.
